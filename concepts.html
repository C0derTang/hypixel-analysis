                    <h3>Average Value</h3>
                    <p>Hypixel Network, one of the largest Minecraft server networks globally, experienced significant changes in user activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the average daily player counts during pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods as declared by the World Health Organization, we can begin to understand these fluctuations and insights into player behavior in response to global events.</p>
                    <p>The average on an interval can be found by taking the definite integral of the trend line over one of the designated time periods.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Lockdown: Jul 23 2015 - Jan 30 2020</li>
                        <li> Jan 30 2020 - May 5, 2023</li>
                        <li>Post-Lockdown: May 5, 2023 - Feb 19 2024</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Pre-Lockdown</h4>
                    <img src="prelockdown.png">
                    <p>Before the public health emergency was declared, Hypixel averaged around 36297 players a day.</p>

                    <h4>Lockdown</h4>
                    <img src="lockdown.png"> 
                    <p>During the public health emergency (highlighted by the green section in the graph), the average players per day (calculated by the same integral with different bounds) rose to 93868 players</p>

                    <h4>Post-Lockdown</h4>
                    <img src="postlockdown.png"> 
                    <p>After the crisis, the average daily player dropped to around 80859 players</p>
