                    Firstly, the New York Tech article was correct when saying that video game player count increased during the COVID-19 lockdown period, 
                    as the first analysis demonstrated that the entire COVID-19 time period was within an increasing interval.
                    <br><br>
                    However, the second analysis that used the second derivative function to determine when the point of inflection, 
                    or maximum value of the first derivative, occurred, 
                    demonstrated that the growth rate (the first derivative) peaked right before the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown period, 
                    disproving the New York Tech article’s statement that peak growth rate of video game usage occurred during the pandemic (at least for the Hypixel server). 
                    The third analysis, using the average value across the trend line (integrating over an interval and then dividing by the bounds) 
                    highlighted the significant increase in average video game players on a daily basis during the COVID-19 period, 
                    proving the New York Tech article right that the number of video game players increased. 
                    The fourth analysis used the Mean Value Theorem to calculate when the instantaneous rate of change equaled the average rate of change. 
                    Within the bounds of the COVID-19 lockdown interval, it was found that the growth rate in the last 5 days of the time period was significantly greater than the average rate of change over the interval, 
                    since the majority of the days in the interval (which were before the point where AROC=IROC) had an instantaneous rate of change below the average rate of change. 
                    In the fifth analysis, we used Euler’s method to determine the expected value of video game players based on the time period before the pandemic to understand how the video game player count for the Hypixel server during the pandemic lockdown period differed from the expected value. 
                    The fifth analysis established a clear, unforeseen jump in player count compared to Euler’s method’s expected value during the pandemic, 
                    indicating that the pandemic influenced player count growth to a value much larger than expected. 
                    While the article had figures to prove their stance on an increase in video gamers over the pandemic, 
                    it lacked data to justify its claim that video game usage growth rate peaked. To determine the future population of Hypixel players, 
                    we can use the Euler’s method of approximation used in the fifth analysis.
