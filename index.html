                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>
                    This project examines the relationship between the number of players of Hypixel, 
                    the world's largest Minecraft server, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                    The global lockdown and the onset of social distancing policies have led to unprecedented user engagement on digital platforms.
                    <br><br>
                    Known for its wide variety of mini-games and vibrant communities, Hypixel serves as an interesting case study for this phenomenon. The aim of this study is to understand how external factors, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic, affected online gaming communities,
                    focusing on player participation in the form of daily active users. 
                    <br><br>
                    From verifying the notion of player count increasing over the period to calculating the average number of players on a daily basis, 
                    this calculus-based data analysis utilizes topics like first derivative, second derivative (concavity and point of inflection), 
                    integration, the Mean Value Theorem, and Eulerâ€™s Method to examine the extent to which the epidemic has acted as a catalyst for the rise of online activity, 
                    with a particular emphasis on gaming.
